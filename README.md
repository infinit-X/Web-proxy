# Vercel Web Proxy

A secure web proxy application deployed on Vercel using serverless functions. This tool allows you to access blocked websites by routing traffic through Vercel's trusted infrastructure.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Proxying**: All traffic is routed through HTTPS-encrypted connections
- **Corporate Network Friendly**: Uses Vercel's `*.vercel.app` domain which is typically allowed
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, responsive web interface with quick access buttons
- **Smart Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and timeout handling
- **Security Measures**: Prevents access to internal/local networks to avoid abuse

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js serverless functions on Vercel
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for robust request handling
- **Deployment**: GitHub integration with Vercel

## üì¶ Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier works perfectly)
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)

### Quick Deploy to Vercel

1. **Fork/Clone this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Access your proxy**:
   - Your proxy will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
   - Enter any URL in the input field and click "Go"

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Start local development server
npm run dev
# or
vercel dev

# Your local proxy will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

## üéØ Usage

1. **Open your deployed proxy** (e.g., `https://your-proxy.vercel.app`)
2. **Enter a URL** in the input field (with or without `https://`)
3. **Click "Go"** or press Enter
4. **Browse securely** through the proxy

### Quick Access Buttons
The interface includes quick access buttons for popular sites:
- Google
- YouTube  
- Reddit
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Configured for serverless function deployment
- 30-second timeout for proxy requests
- Optimized routing for both static files and API endpoints

### Security Features
- Blocks access to internal/local networks (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, private IP ranges)
- Removes problematic headers that might break iframe embedding
- Sets appropriate CORS headers for security

## üîß Customization

### Adding More Quick Links
Edit the `index.html` file and add buttons in the `.quick-links` section:

```html
<button class="quick-link" onclick="loadQuickSite('https://example.com')">Example</button>
```

### Modifying the Proxy Logic
The main proxy logic is in `/api/proxy.js`. You can:
- Adjust timeout values
- Modify request headers
- Add additional security checks
- Customize error handling

### Styling Changes
All styles are contained in the `<style>` section of `index.html`. The design uses:
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## üìä Vercel Limits (Free Tier)

- **Bandwidth**: 100 GB/month (generous for personal use)
- **Function Invocations**: 1M/month
- **Function Duration**: 10 seconds (we use 30s for better compatibility)
- **Build Time**: 100 hours/month

These limits are typically sufficient for personal proxy usage.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### What This Proxy Does
- Encrypts all traffic between you and the proxy server
- Masks your requests as traffic to Vercel (harder to block)
- Provides a secure tunnel for accessing blocked content

### What This Proxy Doesn't Do
- **Not anonymous**: Your Vercel logs may contain access records
- **Not for illegal activity**: Use responsibly and follow your organization's policies
- **Not bulletproof**: Advanced DPI systems might still detect proxy usage

### Recommended Usage
- Use for accessing legitimate blocked content
- Respect your organization's acceptable use policies  
- Consider the legal implications in your jurisdiction
- Don't use for malicious activities

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load the website"**
- The target website might be down
- Some sites actively block proxy requests
- Try adding `https://` to the URL

**"Request timeout"**
- The website is slow to respond
- Vercel function timeout (30s) was reached
- Try again or use a different URL

**"Domain not found"**
- Check the URL spelling
- Ensure the domain exists and is accessible

### Error Codes
- `400`: Missing or invalid URL parameter
- `403`: Blocked URL (internal/local addresses)
- `404`: Domain not found
- `408`: Request timeout
- `500`: General proxy error
